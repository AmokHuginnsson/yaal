# stdhapi library configuration file.
# comments begin with `#' char and continues until end of line
# configuration file is divided into sections, each section
# begins with [secttion_name] mark, each option may be placed
# only in section it belongs to.
# option names are case insensitive
# in most cases option values are case insensitive also
# syntax for settings is:
# ^{option}{white}{value1 value2 ... valuen}$
# we currently distinguish between four kind of value types:
# bool   - (true|yes|on|false|no|off)
# char   - [a-z]
# int    - [0-1]+
# string - .+
#
# example:
# log_sql true

# what character should be used for composing commands,
# composing commands looks like this:
# user presses CTRL-`command_compose_character', which puts
# process into `command mode' and then
# before `command_compose_delay' passes user should
# press real command character, for example,
# if `command_compose_character' is x,
# then "program exit" command would look like:
# CTRL-x x
# note that in this case "exit" command is done by pressing `x'
# in command mode
command_compose_character x

# how long hconsole-UI waits in `command mode' for user to type
# in real command
