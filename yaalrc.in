# yaal library configuration file.
# comments begin with `#' char and continue until end of line
# configuration file is divided into sections, each section
# begins with [section_name] mark, each option may be placed
# only in section it belongs to.
# option names are case insensitive
# in most cases option values are case insensitive also
# syntax for settings is:
# ^{option}{white}(['"]){value1 value2 ... valuen}\1{white}# comment$
# value may be surrounded by apostrophes or quotation marks
# one level of this surrounding is stripped
# we currently distinguish between four kind of value types:
# bool       - ( yes-flag | no-flag )
# yes-flag   - ( yes | true  | on  | enable  | 1 )
# no-flag    - ( no  | false | off | disable | 0 )
# char       - [a-z]
# int        - [0-9]+
# string     - [^ ].*
# enumerator - string choosen from predefined string set
# bit field  - (sub)set of given set of predefined strings
#
# example:
# log_sql true
