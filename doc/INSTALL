*** stdhapi documentation ***

First of all, if you did not read READ.ME.FIRST.OR.DIE go there now.

* System requirements:

	libraries:
	- ncurses
	- MySQL
	- PostGreSQL

	tools:
	- autoconf
	- GNU make
	- gcc/g++

	other:
	- lots of guts

* Installation process:

	- $ cd /path/to/stdhapi
	- $ autoconf
	- pray
	- $ ./configure
	- pray
	- $ make 
	# $ gmake #in case of FreeBSD.
	- pray with passion
	- $ make install 
	# (last step applays only if it is first time you install stdhapi
	   and you have not struggled with LD_LIBRARY_PATH already, if you have
		 modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH before you have to use the source Luke (aux/msh)
		 and see what has to be done.)
