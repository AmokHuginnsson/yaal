* Installation process:

Installation process can vary from platform type (FreeBSD/non-FreeBSD),
usage so far (fresh install/update), and your expirience (expert/non-expert).
So we have six posibilities (yes I know that 2*2*2==8) which we explain below.

Lines that starts with `$' represent commands, lines that start with `#'
represent comments, for example:

	$ rm -fr /
	# this is comment, and the line above is a funny command

Let installation begin.

# common step for all cases
	$ cd /path/to/yaal/
	$ svn up

# first case (FreeBSD/update/expert)
	$ make

# second case (FreeBSD/update/non-expert)
	$ make purge
	$ make

# third case (FreeBSD/fresh install)
	$ make
# (next step applays only if you have not struggled with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# already, if you have modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH before you have to use
# the source Luke (_aux/msh) and see what has to be done.)
	$ make install

# fourth case (non-FreeBSD/update/expert)
	$ autoconf
	$ ./configure
	$ make

# fifth case (non-FreeBSD/update/non-expert)
	$ make purge
	$ autoconf
	$ ./configure
	$ make mrproper
	$ make

# sixth case (non-FreeBSD/fresh install)
	$ autoconf
	$ ./configure
	$ make
# (next step applays only if you have not struggled with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# already, if you have modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH before you have to use
# the source Luke (_aux/msh) and see what has to be done.)
	$ make install

# common step for all cases
# in case of error, read FAQ, if reading FAQ did not help email
# developer with full info about your problem
