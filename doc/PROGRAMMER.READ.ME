To all curious programmers.

I am aware of stl::list existence.
I am aware of stl::vector existence.
I am aware of stl::map existence.
I am aware of stl::string existence.
I am aware of boost::shared_ptr existence.
I am aware of boost::shared_array existence.

I have implemented equivalents of those classes
solely for educational purposes.
